# LAMPStackLearn
Repo created to play around with php and learn about LAMP stack


##STEP1 ##

My first step was to connect the linux server to myGitHub repo. 
I followed the instructions on this link: https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-ssh-git-repository-linux-command-line-tzu-hung-derry-yeh

But I'm going to list what I consider the most important: 
1. Create a new repo on GitHub as public 
2. Initiate git on the local folder "git init"
3. Add the remote repo "git remote add origin "http://url....." " 
4. Git pull origin master FIRST
5. Git push origin master SECOND
6. Make sure you are on the remote branch "git branch -a" not the local one
